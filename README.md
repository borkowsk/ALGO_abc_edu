# ALGO Pascal ABC

ALGO is a kind of simplified PASCAL implementation with very simple IDE. 
It was working under old versions od Windows (at least up to 7.) and still may work under Wine.

In Poland it was distributed by OEIIZK: https://algo.oeiizk.waw.pl/ 

But I'm not sure that this is still available anywhere :-D
